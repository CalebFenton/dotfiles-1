# RichGuk's dotfiles

My dotfiles/setup scripts that are used on variables machines I use.


## Setup

Setup main symlinks

```
curl -L http://git.io/richguk-dotsetup | bash
```

Mac only setup (installs applications, and configures settings)

```
./bin/mac_setup.sh
```

Done.


## Credit

The various places I've pinched stuff from. :)
